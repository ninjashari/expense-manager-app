## üîç **Technical Implementation**

### **Bill Generation Logic**
```typescript
// Enhanced bill period calculation
function calculateBillPeriod(billGenerationDay: number, targetYear: number, targetMonth: number) {
  const billGenerationDate = new Date(targetYear, targetMonth, billGenerationDay)
  const billPeriodEnd = new Date(billGenerationDate)
  billPeriodEnd.setDate(billPeriodEnd.getDate() - 1)
  const billPeriodStart = new Date(targetYear, targetMonth - 1, billGenerationDay)
  
  return { billPeriodStart, billPeriodEnd, billGenerationDate }
}

// First transaction inclusion logic
// Always starts from account opening month to ensure first transaction is included
// Bill period includes account opening date: (billPeriodStart <= accountOpeningDate && billPeriodEnd >= accountOpeningDate)
```

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/credit-card-bills`: Fetch bills (with optional accountId filter)
