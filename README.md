## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm
- A MongoDB database (you can get a free one from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add the following variables.

    ```env
    # MongoDB Connection String from MongoDB Atlas
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"

    # NextAuth.js Configuration
    # Generate a secret using: openssl rand -base64 32
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
    NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

    # AI Analysis (Automatic - no setup required)
    # Powered by Puter.js - provides free AI analysis
    # No API key needed - works automatically

    # Currency Exchange API (Optional - for multi-currency support)
    # Get free API key from: https://exchangerate-api.com/
    EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY="your_exchange_rate_api_key_here"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## CSV Import Feature

The application includes an intelligent CSV import system that can automatically analyze and import your financial data:

### Supported Data Types
- **Transactions:** Date, amount, payee, account, category, notes
- **Accounts:** Name, type, currency, balance
- **Categories:** Name, type (income/expense)

### AI Analysis
- **Automatic Column Detection:** Uses AI to identify column types and suggest mappings
- **Smart Fallback:** If AI is unavailable, uses advanced pattern matching
- **No Setup Required:** Works automatically with Puter.js integration
- **Completely Free:** Unlimited AI analysis with no API keys or quotas

### Import Process
1. Upload your CSV file
2. AI analyzes the structure and suggests column mappings
3. Review and adjust mappings as needed
4. Preview the data before importing
5. Import with validation and error reporting
